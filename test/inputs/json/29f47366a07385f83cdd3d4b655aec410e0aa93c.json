Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/hidehidehidden\"&gt;u/hidehidehidden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: This is an early release (\u201calpha\u201d) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: When will this roll out to everyone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we\u2019re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There\u2019s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that\u2019s ok too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How will brands participate in this program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in &lt;a href=\"/r/LeagueOfLegends\"&gt;r/LeagueOfLegends&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere \u2014 therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can\u2019t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt; community as we grow and test this new product. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We\u2019re also testing a new feature called \u201cActive in these Communities\u201d on the tester\u2019s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: This is one reason that we\u2019re being so careful about how we\u2019re testing this feature \u2014 we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt; as the product develops and we onboard more users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what\u2019s the difference between the two?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What about the existing \u201cfriends\u201d feature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We\u2019re not making any changes to the existing \u201cfriends\u201d feature or &lt;a href=\"/r/friends\"&gt;r/friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user&amp;#39;s ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don\u2019t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I\u2019m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you\u2019re wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We don\u2019t have all of the answers right now and that\u2019s why we\u2019re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we\u2019re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won\u2019t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I participate in this beta?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A:  We\u2019ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We\u2019re also taking direct applications via this &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi Reddit!\n\n\nReddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.\n\n\nReddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You\u2019ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We\u2019re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.\n\n\n##What does it look like?\n* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour\u2019s new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he\u2019s doing an AMA. \n* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing \n* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  \n* On our mobile apps, you can search for \u201cshitty_watercolour\u201d, \u201ckn0thing\u201d, \u201cleagueoflegends\u201d and you\u2019ll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) \n\n##What is it?\n* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors\n* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile\n* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months \n\n##Who is this for?\n* We want to build this feature for all users but we\u2019re starting with a small group of alpha testers. \n\n##How does it work?\n* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).\n* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our \u201cfriends\u201d feature.\n* You can comment on their profile posts\n* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. \n\n##What\u2019s next?\n* We\u2019re taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit\u2019s existing communities, which is why we\u2019re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. \n* We\u2019ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) \n\n##How do I participate?\n* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).\n* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). \n\n##TL;DR: \n\nWe\u2019re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers).

2017.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;amp;hl=en\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;. It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago\u2014especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven\u2019t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits\"&gt;moderator mail&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/\"&gt;mobile website&lt;/a&gt;. We added &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/\"&gt;image hosting&lt;/a&gt; on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/\"&gt;blocking tool&lt;/a&gt;, which made a nice dent in reported abuse.

I ruined Thanksgiving. I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you are aware of my attempt to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;amp;sh=a9c7a036\"&gt;troll the trolls&lt;/a&gt; last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/\"&gt;explained what I did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt;), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, &lt;a href=\"/u/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt;, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when we separate the behavior of some of &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy\"&gt;Content Policy&lt;/a&gt; asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; will no longer appear in &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; does to slingshot posts into &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; for all users.

You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users.

We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn\u2019t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to \u201cdown mode\u201d while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance. By 18:19PDT, latency returned to normal, and all systems were operating normally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations.

But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution, which we\u2019re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we\u2019re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they\u2019re interested in promoting the post&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We\u2019ll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we\u2019re launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we\u2019ll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment.

We\u2019ll speak with our developer community before making any potential changes there.*\n\nHow long will the test run for?\n*The test will run for at least 4 weeks, possibly longer.*", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "4phzsi", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "starfishjenga", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "can_mod_post": false, "name": "t3_4phzsi", "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.announcements", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?s=f8cc2e63300e10b0cf63849dadcd9c8b", "width": 5376, "height": 3679}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=877fa207b6e2f3460bf3578db59444a5", "width": 108, "height": 73}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=c32e7c0a1a4a6a8cba0f5ddf968b9631", "width": 216, "height": 147}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=97f912bafd4ca00d4fff8fc0bdfe02f3", "width": 320, "height": 218}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=a46a01dd17398a4a8717f62fff0d7fad", "width": 640, "height": 437}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=cfe80968873aa1675e8b0acae2f08658", "width": 960, "height": 656}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/-fLf0KguPqfPVlz5xkO9Mdty-kUgyuhXKm7LiJz62eU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=1854c4ec7c5a4cdf6e9c11606149a054", "width": 1080, "height": 739}], "variants": {}, "id": "oG8Mq0Ngp3D1JeS3ntATK17oIQ8otTGNNbyPIFmN1IY"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0ij", "edited": 1466713208.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gilded": 0, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": true, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1466732440.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "title": "Sponsored headline tests: placement and design", "created_utc": 1466703640.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/announcements", "distinguished": "admin", "media": null, "num_comments": 1080, "is_self": true, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "is_video": false, "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "announcements", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;.

With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.  \n\nThough Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are *reusing passwords between sites*.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:\n\n * Choose a [strong, **unique** password](https://xkcd.com/936/).

We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.

I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team \u2013 we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.\n\n**11PM PT Edit:** Ok I've been answering on and off all day. I will keep reading top comments but will be replying less now.
