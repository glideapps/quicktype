Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (\u201cKnight\u201d) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici &lt;a href=\"http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/\"&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court\u2019s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230\u2019s immunity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.

Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You\u2019ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We\u2019re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What does it look like?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Check-out &lt;a href=\"/u/Shitty_Watercolour\"&gt;u/Shitty_Watercolour&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s new profile page: &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour\"&gt;http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour&lt;/a&gt; where he\u2019s doing an AMA. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reddit co-founder &lt;a href=\"/u/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt; is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing\"&gt;http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Riot Games is participating under &lt;a href=\"/u/LeagueOfLegends\"&gt;u/LeagueOfLegends&lt;/a&gt; where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends\"&gt;http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On our mobile apps, you can search for \u201cshitty_watercolour\u201d, \u201ckn0thing\u201d, \u201cleagueoflegends\u201d and you\u2019ll see them as &lt;a href=\"/u/shitty_watercolour\"&gt;u/shitty_watercolour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/leagueoflegends\"&gt;u/leagueoflegends&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png\"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Who is this for?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We want to build this feature for all users but we\u2019re starting with a small group of alpha testers. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. &lt;a href=\"/u/Shitty_Watercolour\"&gt;u/Shitty_Watercolour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/LeagueOfLegends\"&gt;u/LeagueOfLegends&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our \u201cfriends\u201d feature.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can comment on their profile posts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s next?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re taking feedback on this experience on &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt; and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit\u2019s existing communities, which is why we\u2019re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How do I participate?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They\u2019ll be able to post to their profile and you\u2019ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/hidehidehidden\"&gt;u/hidehidehidden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: This is an early release (\u201calpha\u201d) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: When will this roll out to everyone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we\u2019re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There\u2019s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that\u2019s ok too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How will brands participate in this program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in &lt;a href=\"/r/LeagueOfLegends\"&gt;r/LeagueOfLegends&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere \u2014 therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can\u2019t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt; community as we grow and test this new product. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We\u2019re also testing a new feature called \u201cActive in these Communities\u201d on the tester\u2019s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: This is one reason that we\u2019re being so careful about how we\u2019re testing this feature \u2014 we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in &lt;a href=\"/r/beta\"&gt;r/beta&lt;/a&gt; as the product develops and we onboard more users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what\u2019s the difference between the two?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What about the existing \u201cfriends\u201d feature?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We\u2019re not making any changes to the existing \u201cfriends\u201d feature or &lt;a href=\"/r/friends\"&gt;r/friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user&amp;#39;s ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don\u2019t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I\u2019m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you\u2019re wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A: We don\u2019t have all of the answers right now and that\u2019s why we\u2019re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we\u2019re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won\u2019t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I participate in this beta?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A:  We\u2019ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We\u2019re also taking direct applications via this &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this &lt;a href=\"https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l\"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
                    "selftext": "Hi Reddit!\n\n\nReddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.\n\n\nReddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You\u2019ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We\u2019re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.\n\n\n##What does it look like?\n* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour\u2019s new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he\u2019s doing an AMA. \n* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing \n* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  \n* On our mobile apps, you can search for \u201cshitty_watercolour\u201d, \u201ckn0thing\u201d, \u201cleagueoflegends\u201d and you\u2019ll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) \n\n##What is it?\n* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors\n* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile\n* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months \n\n##Who is this for?\n* We want to build this feature for all users but we\u2019re starting with a small group of alpha testers. \n\n##How does it work?\n* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).\n* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our \u201cfriends\u201d feature.\n* You can comment on their profile posts\n* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. \n\n##What\u2019s next?\n* We\u2019re taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit\u2019s existing communities, which is why we\u2019re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. \n* We\u2019ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) \n\n##How do I participate?\n* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).\n* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). \n\n##TL;DR: \n\nWe\u2019re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They\u2019ll be able to post to their profile and you\u2019ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta! \n\nu/hidehidehidden\n\n------------\n\n##Q&amp;A:\n\n**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**\n\nA: This is an early release (\u201calpha\u201d) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.\n\n----\n\n**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**\n\nA: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. \n\n---\n\n**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**\n\nA: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months.

It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago\u2014especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views.

I won\u2019t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter &lt;a href=\"/r/all\"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you are aware of my attempt to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;amp;sh=a9c7a036\"&gt;troll the trolls&lt;/a&gt; last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/\"&gt;explained what I did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt;), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, &lt;a href=\"/u/kn0thing\"&gt;u/kn0thing&lt;/a&gt;, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the &lt;a href=\"/r/the_donald\"&gt;r/the_donald&lt;/a&gt; outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so.

                    "selftext": "**tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users.

It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it.

Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/\"&gt;live thread&lt;/a&gt;, and notable changes to the site are listed in &lt;a href=\"/r/changelog\"&gt;r/changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/\"&gt;tested adding affiliate tags&lt;/a&gt; to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/\"&gt;Promoted User Posts&lt;/a&gt;; and we announced &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/\"&gt;tests we\u2019ll be running&lt;/a&gt; on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in &lt;a href=\"/r/changelog\"&gt;r/changelog&lt;/a&gt; so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we previewed &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/\"&gt;new moderator mail&lt;/a&gt; to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off.

When we\u2019re thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we\u2019re creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution, which we\u2019re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we\u2019re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they\u2019re interested in promoting the post&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

                    "selftext": "**TL;DR - [here is what this ad is](https://i.redd.it/dyib2c0odmbx.png)**\n\nHi all,\n \nWe\u2019ve been working on some new ad products. When we\u2019re thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we\u2019re creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.\n \nIn conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.\n \nThe solution, which we\u2019re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we\u2019re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. \n\nHow it works:\n\n* A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content\n* A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they\u2019re interested in promoting the post\n* Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post\n* If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)\n* The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.\n\n**Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.**\n\nFor a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see [here](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png). (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)\n\nBoth of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We\u2019ll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.\n\nWhile we\u2019re launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we\u2019ll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment. Our experiment with [affiliate links](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) has ended for the time being. We\u2019ve decided that focusing our energies on advertising is more congruent with our long term strategy.\n\nThanks for reading, and happy redditing!\n\nCheers,\n\nu/starfishjenga\n\n___\n**FAQ**\n\n**Q: I don\u2019t want my content used as an advertisement, how do I avoid this?**\nNo content will be turned into a promoted post without the submitter\u2019s explicit permission.

We believe that this will help Reddit move closer to becoming a long-term sustainable business with an average small to zero negative impact to the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, users who are (randomly) selected to be part of the test group will see a redesigned version of the sponsored headline moving between positions 1-6 in the content feed on desktop. You can see examples of a couple design variants &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/W2zUlcS.jpg\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GppJVkh.jpg\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (we may introduce new test variants as we gather more data). We tried to strike a balance with ads that are clearly labeled but not too loud or obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will be monitoring a couple of things.

                    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe\u2019re going to be launching a test on Monday, June 27 to get a better understanding of the costs and benefits of putting sponsored headlines inside the content feed vs. at the top. We believe that this will help Reddit move closer to becoming a long-term sustainable business with an average small to zero negative impact to the user experience.\n\nSpecifically, users who are (randomly) selected to be part of the test group will see a redesigned version of the sponsored headline moving between positions 1-6 in the content feed on desktop. You can see examples of a couple design variants [here](http://i.imgur.com/W2zUlcS.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/GppJVkh.jpg) (we may introduce new test variants as we gather more data). We tried to strike a balance with ads that are clearly labeled but not too loud or obnoxious.\n\nWe will be monitoring a couple of things. Do we see higher ad engagement when the ads are not pinned to the top of the page? Do we see higher content engagement when the top link is not an ad?\n\nAs usual, feedback on this change is welcome. I\u2019ll be reading your comments and will respond to as many as I can.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nCheers,\n\nu/starfishjenga\n\n**EDIT 1:** Hide functionality will still be available for these new formats.

We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that&amp;#39;s by email.  For almost 11 years we&amp;#39;ve been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you&amp;#39;ve got no reset email, you&amp;#39;re going to have a bad time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/account-activity\"&gt;Check your own account activity page!&lt;/a&gt;  If you see some IPs in there that you don&amp;#39;t recognize (and especially ones from countries you don&amp;#39;t spend much time in), it&amp;#39;s probably not a bad idea to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/\"&gt;change your password&lt;/a&gt;.  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you&amp;#39;ve shared your credentials with, but it&amp;#39;s easy to re-auth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They&amp;#39;ve never posted. They&amp;#39;ve never voted.  They haven&amp;#39;t logged in &lt;em&gt;for several years&lt;/em&gt;.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don&amp;#39;t want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password &amp;quot;hunter2&amp;quot;. Shortly, we&amp;#39;re going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don&amp;#39;t get a reaction in about a month, we&amp;#39;re going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;But how do I make a unique password?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Personally I&amp;#39;m a big fan of tools like &lt;a href=\"https://lastpass.com/\"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://1password.com/\"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known &lt;a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/11/passwords_are_not_br.html\"&gt;heuristics&lt;/a&gt;.  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I&amp;#39;ll edit in a plug.]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;What&amp;#39;s with the fear mongering??&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ua725p02cizw.jpg\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a rough month.&lt;/a&gt; Also, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc\"&gt;don&amp;#39;t just take it from me this is important.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Jeez, guys why don&amp;#39;t you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;#39;re definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It&amp;#39;s behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&amp;amp;hl=en\"&gt;huge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader&amp;amp;hl=en\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8\"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, including our newly released &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;amp;hl=en\"&gt;android&lt;/a&gt; clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  &amp;quot;Adding 2FA to the login flow&amp;quot; will require a lot of coordination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it&amp;#39;ll be...!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Please. Stop.  We&amp;#39;re not talking about removing content, and so we&amp;#39;re certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know &lt;a href=\"/user/me\"&gt;who the enemy is&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/\"&gt;why!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Do you realize you linked to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/&lt;/a&gt; like three times?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Actually it was four.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;:  As promised (and thanks everyone for the suggestions!)

They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password \"hunter2\". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!\n\n---\n\n**Q**: *But how do I make a unique password?*\n\n**A**: Personally I'm a big fan of tools like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/) because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known [heuristics](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/11/passwords_are_not_br.html).  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I'll edit in a plug.]\n\n**Q**: *What's with the fear mongering??*\n\n**A**: [It's been a rough month.](https://i.redd.it/ua725p02cizw.jpg) Also, [don't just take it from me this is important.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc)\n\n**Q**: *Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?*\n\n**A**: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if *we* get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.  \n\nUnfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a [huge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&amp;hl=en) [ecosystem](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8) [of](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader&amp;hl=en) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8), including our newly released [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en) clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  \"Adding 2FA to the login flow\" will require a lot of coordination.\n\n**Q**: *Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!*\n\n**A**: Please. Stop.  We're not talking about removing content, and so we're certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know [who the enemy is](/user/me) and [why!](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/)\n\n**Q**: *Do you realize you linked to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/ like three times?*\n\n**A**: Actually it was four.  \n\n---\n\n**Edit**:  As promised (and thanks everyone for the suggestions!) I'd like to call out the following: \n\n   * [Keepassx](https://www.keepassx.org/) and [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) as password managers\n   * [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android)\n   * https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as a way to check if your account could be compromisible. \n\n**Edit 2:** [Here's an awesome word-cloud of this post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4l60nc/reddit_account_security_and_you/d3kl5js)\n\n**Edit 3:** More good tools:\n  \n  * [Password Safe](https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/) -- Schneier approved!\n  * [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) for Linux",
