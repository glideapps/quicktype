Watts is wanted in Texas for charges of aggravated sexual assault of a minor, beginning when the minor was three years old and continuing over a prolonged period of time. In 2012, Watts fled the United States, resulting in the issuance of federal felony charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"presscontenttext\">\n<p>In April, INTERPOL Washington expedited the publication of an INTERPOL Red Notice, or international wanted persons notice, for Watts based on the charges in Texas. The Red Notice was disseminated via INTERPOL's network to its 190 member countries around the world. Based on the efforts of investigators from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) International Investigations Branch, USMS Western District of Texas, and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security Service, Watts' was traced to Oman where the INTERPOL Red Notice provided police with the authority to arrest and lawfully return Watts to the United States on May 15. Watts is currently in the custody of U.S. authorities and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>\n\n<p>INTERPOL Washington Director Shawn Bray stated, \u201cThe capture of Shilo Watts is a great example of partnership between foreign, federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities, including the U.S. Marshals Service, Diplomatic Security Service, Office of International Affairs at the U.S. Department of Justice, and INTERPOL Washington. Through the close coordination of these authorities paired with the use of INTERPOL's international resources, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Diplomatic Security Service located, arrested and returned Watts to face justice in Texas in a matter of days.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</root>",

            "body": "<root><p>WASHINGTON <strong>-</strong> A joint investigation between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), and Interpol Washington (U.S. National Central Bureau) has led to the publication of the first-ever Interpol Purple Notice issued by the United States for a vessel believed to be engaged in illegal fishing activities.</p>\n\n<div class=\"presscontenthdr-container\">\n<div class=\"presscontenttext\">\n<p>According to the Purple Notice, the fishing vessel named 'Stellar' was sighted twice in May 2014 operating on the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean by the USCG. It appears to change its name, national registration and other identifying characteristics in order to hide illegal activity. 'Stellar' is suspected of engaging in illicit fisheries transshipment activities near the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>\n\n<p>'Stellar' was last known to have arrived in the port of Busan, Korea on June 3, 2014. The USCG provided information to the Korean authorities regarding the suspicious activities of 'Stellar' and recommended the vessel be inspected for potential violations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIllegal fisheries activity has a wide-ranging impact on the health and sustainability of the oceans fish stocks,\u201d said Bruce Buckson, Director of NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement. \u201cWe're pleased to be working with Interpol, its member agencies, and the U.S. Coast Guard to combat this type of activity. We expect this international effort will help level the playing field for U.S. domestic fishers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI commend NOAA, the USCG and Interpol Washington's Economic Crimes Division representatives for their extraordinary efforts, collaboration and partnership during this investigation which has resulted in the first Interpol Purple Notice issued by U.S. law enforcement authorities,\u201d stated Interpol Washington Director Shawn A. Bray.</p>\n\n<p>The United States wishes to make all 189 other Interpol member countries aware of the suspected illegal operations of the fishing vessel 'Stellar' (also known as 'Sungari'). By raising awareness of this vessel's operations, member countries will be able to investigate possible violations of their laws and take appropriate enforcement measures should the vessel attempt to operate illegally in their waters or ports, or under their national jurisdiction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</root>",
