            "body": "<root><div class=\"presscontenttext\">\n<p>Good afternoon everyone and thank you for that introduction. I am Tom Perrelli and I serve as the Associate Attorney General, the third-ranking official in the Department of Justice. As part of my job, I oversee the Department of Justice\u2019s civil, civil rights, tax, antitrust and environmental litigating divisions, as well as all of our grant making programs for state, local and tribal law enforcement. That includes the Office on Violence Against Women, which does terrific work with law enforcement across the country by, among other things, sponsoring conferences such as this one. I am honored to speak with you today, and I want to thank you on behalf of the Obama Administration for everything you do to keep our communities safe throughout D.C., Maryland and my home since I was born, the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>All over the country, committed law enforcement officers like you watch over our neighborhoods and work to make our nation a safer, more secure place. I am especially appreciative that you are here today, focusing on domestic violence, sexual assault and other forms of intimate abuse. As all of you know, every day, mothers, sisters, daughters and wives fall victim to domestic violence. This violence has devastating effects on not only the victims, but other family members and entire communities across the country. We have accomplished a lot in the last 15 years since Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act, and federal, state and local authorities began to work as partners in bringing an end to the violence. But much remains to be done.</p>\n\n<p>America needs you working hard in this fight. And the Department of Justice needs to stand with you. At every level of the Department, from the Attorney General on down, we are committed to restoring a robust partnership with state, local and tribal law enforcement to bring safety to America\u2019s communities. That began when the Attorney General brought together state, local and tribal law enforcement officers to a summit almost immediately after he took office to hear about what was happening on the ground in the communities, what the federal government was doing well, what it wasn't, and how we could work more effectively together across a wide range of areas. And we will continue to rebuild those relationships because we know that only by working together as a team can we have the greatest impact on crime and public safety.</p>\n\n<p>President Obama and this DOJ know that the current economic difficulties faced by the country are putting enormous strains on law enforcement. That is why the President fought to ensure that, as part of his effort to restore the economy, the federal government was supporting the men and women who are on the front lines in local communities all across the country. I stand here today \u2013 on the 100<sup>th</sup> day since the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act into law \u2013 to tell you what we\u2019ve done to invest in you and others who keep our communities safe every day.</p>\n\n<p>We all know that the Recovery Act is helping to stimulate the economy by directly saving and creating jobs across the country. But it is also helping the economy in the same way that you and your colleagues help the economy every day: by making our communities safe for our fellow citizens to keep their businesses open, get to and from work, and go about their daily lives. Without safe streets, new businesses do not open and existing businesses shut down or reduce their hours, people do not buy homes or rent apartments, and economic renewal has little hope. We have seen this dynamic in major cities and rural areas throughout the country. But if we make communities and families safe, we provide the building blocks for our renewed economy.</p>\n\n<p>The Recovery Act recognized this by including more than $4 billion for state, local and tribal law enforcement, and other criminal and juvenile justice activities. At the Department of Justice, we\u2019re getting that money out through the Office of Justice Programs, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, and the Office on Violence Against Women.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t want to read you a laundry list \u2013 but I do want to highlight the funding in the Recovery Act that is supporting the work and initiatives you have been discussing this week, in no small part because I want you to know all of the areas in which you can be asking for our support. Although we are well along the way to getting money appropriated by the Recovery Act out to local communities, the Department continues to work to support state and local law enforcement in all of these areas, including through funds budgeted in the 2009 appropriation and sought for 2010.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll start with the Office of Justice Programs, which provides federal leadership in developing the nation\u2019s capacity to prevent and control crime, administer justice and assist victims. OJP is responsible for carrying out more than $2.7 billion of Recovery Act grants. Funding is available through initiatives such as the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant \u2013 or JAG \u2013 Program, the Byrne Competitive Grant Program, Assistance to Rural Law Enforcement to Combat Crime and Drugs, grants for Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces, and grants for victim compensation and assistance.</p>\n\n<p>This means increased funding for local governments and states to support a wide range of criminal justice activities, including drug and gang task forces, courts and corrections activities, and treatment, prevention and victim services. There are also competitive grants available to help state, local and tribal communities improve the capacity of local justice systems, including training and technical assistance. One of the things we hear most from local law enforcement is the need for forensic specialists and other support personnel to assist you in building a case and analyzing evidence. We fund such personnel through the Byrne Competitive Grant Program.</p>\n\n<p>The Recovery Act funding also includes an investment to support the Department\u2019s commitment to spurring other technological advances that support law enforcement activities. It provides funding to support projects that address things such as interoperability, communications and decision making, information sharing, electronic crime, and concealed weapons detection.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve distributed over $1.1 billion of this funding to agencies in need, including nearly $70 million in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, and we are quickly processing grant applications to ensure that the rest of the funding gets to our communities as soon as possible. The Office of Justice Programs team is doing great work, as we have put extraordinary demands on them to get the money out as quickly as possible without compromising one bit on making sure that taxpayer dollars are being well spent. The President and Vice-President have committed to unprecedented transparency and accountability for programs under the Recovery Act. I know this process takes some time, but we need to do this right.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Department\u2019s best known program for supporting local law enforcement is our Community Oriented Policing Services \u2013 or COPS \u2013 Office. The COPS Office provides grants, training, technical assistance, best practices and applied research directly to the 18,000 state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Since 1995, the COPS Office has provided over $12 billion to help law enforcement advance the practice of community policing, and has enabled more than 13,200 state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire nearly 117,000 police officers and deputies through more than 38,000 grants.</p>\n\n<p>This support from the COPS Office provides much-needed resources and assists in promoting proven crime fighting strategy. The Recovery Act provided $1 billion to create or save law enforcement officer jobs, which will both stimulate our economy and promote community policing by putting more officers and deputies on patrol in neighborhoods throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>This grant program has provided the Department with a true understanding of the difficulties facing law enforcement departments today. We estimated that our $1 billion will fund somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,500 jobs. The COPS Office received applications from over 7,000 law enforcement agencies for $8.3 billion in requested funds, to create or save more than 39,000 law enforcement officer jobs. Obviously, there are going to be a lot of requests that we won\u2019t be able to fund. But the demand has taught us one thing: this program, and the community oriented policing you are doing across the country, matter a great deal, and the President\u2019s commitment to put 50,000 police officers on the street in the coming years is one that we must fulfill.</p>\n\n<p>The third area of the Department\u2019s focus, and the work at the heart of what you are doing at this symposium, is in the Office on Violence Against Woman or OVW. In the Recovery Act, OVW received $225 million to support five of its grant programs, including the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program, the Transitional Housing Assistance Program, the Grants to Tribal Governments Program, and funds to support state and tribal Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Coalitions.</p>\n\n<p>STOP stands for Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors. As its name suggests, the STOP Grants promote a comprehensive approach to responding to domestic violence. The program funds a variety of programs aimed at reducing domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault crimes, and seeks to encourage everyone in the community to work together to end the violence. The STOP Program requires each state to allocate at least 25 percent of funds under the STOP Program for law enforcement. Activities funded include dedicated domestic violence or sexual assault officers and detectives, training for law enforcement on violence against women, victim-witness personnel within law enforcement offices, and special programs within probation, parole, and corrections offices.</p>\n\n<p>The Transitional Housing program supports the local resources that all of you know about and that you are learning more about here today \u2013 the shelters, the counseling services, and other support services who work with you on addressing these problems.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, while I don\u2019t believe we have many representatives from tribal law enforcement agencies here today, I did mention our Grants to Tribal Governments Program on purpose, because I don\u2019t want any of you to forget that your partnerships with these agencies are as important as your relationships with other localities, with your state and other states, and with us at the Department of Justice. Decreasing violence against women will take all of us \u2013 federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement \u2013 in partnership with public educators and community organizations. That\u2019s why we will continue to support symposiums and programs like this one that allow us to share our best practices and toughest challenges.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice and this Administration are fully committed to supporting state, local and tribal law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. The Recovery Act is not a one-time investment. Only by sustained investment in our communities can we make them safer and make them fit for long-term economic development. Our communities count on you to stand up for them, and we want you to count on us to stand up for you and the work that you do. That includes consistent funding for the training and hiring of cops on the beat and other assistance to make sure that our state and local law enforcement on the \"front lines\" are getting the support they need. And it means opening our doors, and finding ways to coordinate better and help each other that go beyond cashing a check. We are proud to be on your team. I know all of us at the Department of Justice are looking forward to working together in every way that we can.</p>\n\n<p>Again, thank you for allowing me to speak with you today \u2013 and to talk about ways that we are supporting and can support what you are doing. And again, thank you all for being here, for being engaged, and for putting your lives on the line every day.</p>\n</div>\n</root>",

            "body": "<root><div class=\"presscontenttext\">\n<p>Buenas tardes y gracias, Amy, por la presentaci\u00f3n. Deseo agradecer a Valerie Fletcher por recibirnos aqu\u00ed en el Instituto de Diseo Centrado en la Persona Humana. Es un establecimiento muy impresionante que nos muestra el dise\u00f1o universal en acci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n deseo agradecer al Instituto de Justicia Vera por el trabajo que realizan para nuestro Programa de Subsidios por Discapacidad, incluida la organizaci\u00f3n de esta capacitaci\u00f3n. Me complace estar aqu\u00ed hoy para escuchar sobre los programas innovadores que incorporan los principios del dise\u00f1o universal para hacer que los recursos y refugios sean m\u00e1s accesibles a las personas con discapacidades y personas sordas que son v\u00edctimas de la violencia dom\u00e9stica, la violencia en citas, la agresi\u00f3n sexual y el acoso.</p>\n\n<p>Como Subsecretario de Justicia de los Estados Unidos, soy el tercer funcionario en jerarqu\u00eda en el Departamento de Justicia. Mis responsabilidades incluyen la supervisi\u00f3n de nuestros programas de subsidios para las unidades del orden p\u00fablico estatales, locales y tribales y las comunidades de todo el pa\u00eds. Eso incluye la Oficina sobre la Violencia contra la Mujer, la que administra fondos cr\u00edticos para proveedores y programas de servicios para v\u00edctimas en todo el pa\u00eds, incluido el Programa de Subsidios por Discapacidad, que es el motivo por el cual todos ustedes est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed hoy.</p>\n\n<p>Este a\u00f1o se celebran un par de aniversarios extremadamente importantes. Esta semana es el 20<sup>\u00ba</sup> aniversario de la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades, una ley histrica que ha hecho de los Estados Unidos, en las palabras del fallecido Senador Edward Kennedy, \"una mejor y m\u00e1s justa naci\u00f3n\". En septiembre fue el 15\u00b0 aniversario de la promulgaci\u00f3n de la Ley de Violencia contra la Mujer [Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)] por el Presidente Clinton. Al aproximarse el 15\u00ba aniversario de la VAWA, qued\u00f3 claro que necesit\u00e1bamos hacer m\u00e1s que un comunicado de prensa o un \u00fanico evento. Era un buen momento para que el Departamento de Justicia y el gobierno de Obama transmitieran una clara se\u00f1al de que la lucha contra la violencia dom\u00e9stica y sexual es una prioridad nacional. Es por ello que el Departamento lanz\u00f3 una iniciativa de un a\u00f1o de duraci\u00f3n para elevar la concienciaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, crear coaliciones m\u00e1s fuertes entre las comunidades federal, estatales, locales y tribales, y redoblar los esfuerzos para acabar con la violencia dom\u00e9stica y en citas, la agresi\u00f3n sexual y el acoso contra hombres, mujeres y ni\u00f1os de todo el pa\u00eds.</p>\n\n<p>Como parte de la iniciativa, hemos trabajado en asegurar que todos los sobrevivientes en todas partes sepan que tienen un lugar - y una voz - en este gobierno, y en buscar crear un futuro en que el abuso dom\u00e9stico y la agresi\u00f3n sexual hayan sido erradicados. Hemos creado alianzas nuevas entre comunidades rurales, tribales, con personas mayores de edad, j\u00f3venes y militares para compartir las lecciones aprendidas y nuevos e innovadores caminos. Y nos hemos dedicado a tratar de la violencia dom\u00e9stica y la agresi\u00f3n sexual en las comunidades que m\u00e1s han sufrido - en particular, las comunidades ind\u00edgenas estadounidenses e ind\u00edgenas de Alaska, las que pueden sufrir \u00edndices de violencia contra las mujeres 2, 4 o hasta 10 veces superiores al promedio nacional.</p>\n\n<p>Como parte de esta iniciativa, sab\u00edamos que tendr\u00edamos que hablar de cosas que pueden ser dif\u00edciles - cosas como las historias de estadounidenses discapacitados que han sufrido abusos y han sido perseguidos. Al hablar de temas dif\u00edciles no solo a proveedores de servicios y grupos de defensores, sino tambi\u00e9n a grupos empresariales, abogados, fundaciones, agentes de la polic\u00eda, autoridades gubernamentales estatales y locales y otras dependencias federales, incorporamos gente nueva a la lucha. Y homenajeamos a los sobrevivientes que denunciaron, que ayudan a educar a otras personas y que dependen de nosotros para que los protejamos.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>En los Estados Unidos, una de cada cinco personas - o sea, 54.4 millones de estadounidenses - tiene al menos una discapacidad. Si bien no se conoce el n\u00famero exacto de incidentes de violencia contra personas discapacitadas, los pocos estudios que se han llevado a cabo revelan resultados alarmantes. Por ejemplo, las personas discapacitadas tienen de cuatro a diez veces m\u00e1s probabilidades de ser v\u00edctimas de delitos como la violencia dom\u00e9stica y sexual que las personas sin discapacidades. Las personas discapacitadas tienen mayores probabilidades de sufrir persecuciones graves, sufrirlas por tiempos m\u00e1s prolongados, ser v\u00edctimas de m\u00faltiples episodios de abuso, y ser v\u00edctimas de un n\u00famero mayor de autores. El aislamiento, la dependencia en cuidadores para su cuidado personal y otros servicios cotidianos, las opciones limitadas de transporte y la noci\u00f3n entre los autores de que las personas discapacitadas son \"objetivos f\u00e1ciles\" son algunos de los factores que contribuyen para los \u00edndices m\u00e1s altos de persecucin y persecucin recurrente.</p>\n\n<p>Adem\u00e1s de la persecucin proveniente de la violencia, tambi\u00e9n sabemos que las personas discapacitadas enfrentan obst\u00e1culos singulares para obtener la ayuda y los servicios que necesitan. Por ejemplo, los refugios y centros para crisis por violaci\u00f3n pueden no ser f\u00edsicamente o en lo program\u00e1tico accesibles, y, por lo tanto, las personas pueden creer que dichos servicios no son adecuados para ellas. Los proveedores de servicios son especialistas en la violencia dom\u00e9stica y sexual, pero pueden faltarles conocimientos sobre las necesidades de las v\u00edctimas discapacitadas o sordas. Por otro lado, las organizaciones de servicios para discapacitados y sordos suelen carecer de conocimientos en las \u00e1reas de la violencia sexual y dom\u00e9stica. El enjuiciamiento de los infractores representa un desaf\u00edo porque las personas discapacitadas o sordas pueden considerarse testigos inadecuados o se puede utilizar la discapacidad de la persona en su contra. Finalmente, existe falta de colaboraci\u00f3n entre proveedores de servicios para la violencia sexual y dom\u00e9stica, organizaciones para discapacitados y sordos y el sistema de justicia criminal. El resultado es que las v\u00edctimas discapacitadas y sordas no reciben el apoyo y los servicios que tan desesperadamente necesitan.</p>\n\n<p>Reconocemos estos desaf\u00edos y seguiremos trabajando en aumentar la concienciaci\u00f3n y los recursos para servir y combatir el abuso contra personas discapacitadas y sordas. La ADA y el trabajo que realizamos para ampliar su protecci\u00f3n y brindar apoyo a personas discapacitadas y personas sordas son cr\u00edticos para garantizar que los servicios se vuelvan m\u00e1s accesibles. Y la reautorizaci\u00f3n de la VAWA en el 2000 estableci\u00f3 el Programa de Subsidios a la Discapacidad, el que se concentra en la creaci\u00f3n de una infraestructura para brindar apoyo a todas las v\u00edctimas y el desarrollo de servicios y apoyo personalizados para los sobrevivientes con discapacidades y aquellos que son sordos. Es nuestra esperanza en este sentido, as\u00ed como con muchos de los programas de la VAWA, que desarrollemos mejores pr\u00e1cticas y modelos, en colaboraci\u00f3n con quienes trabajan en el campo, proveamos asistencia t\u00e9cnica a defensores y proveedores de servicios de todo el pa\u00eds, y aseguremos que en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os, los proveedores de servicios asociados a la violencia dom\u00e9stica y la agresi\u00f3n sexual comprendan plenamente y satisfagan las necesidades de las v\u00edctimas con discapacidades y las v\u00edctimas sordas.</p>\n\n<p>Es mucho lo que hemos logrado, pero aun queda mucho m\u00e1s por hacer. Sin embargo, no estamos solos en esto. El mensaje central que buscamos transmitir a lo largo del 15\u00ba aniversario de la VAWA es que la violencia dom\u00e9stica y sexual no son apenas problemas de la v\u00edctima y su familia. Son el problema de todos. No puede ser trabajo solo del Departamento de Justicia, o del sistema de justicia criminal, o del gobierno estatal, o de los defensores y proveedores de servicios. L\u00edderes de todos los \u00e1mbitos de los sectores p\u00fablico y privado y cada comunidad deben asumir un papel activo en la respuesta a la agresi\u00f3n sexual y la violencia dom\u00e9stica. Las comunidades deben realizar un trabajo mejor en lo que se refiere a instruirse sobre la violencia dom\u00e9stica y sexual, la prevalencia de la agresi\u00f3n, la necesidad de servicios y apoyo para las v\u00edctimas, y la respuesta necesaria de la justicia criminal a estos delitos. Y debemos trabajar unidos para encontrar enfoques nuevos e innovadores para ayudar a las v\u00edctimas de la delincuencia, y prevenir la violencia en primer lugar.</p>\n\n<p>Gracias por estar aqu\u00ed hoy y por el trabajo esencial que realizan para prevenir el abuso de personas con discapacidades y personas sordas y prestar servicios a dichas v\u00edctimas. Nosotros, en el Departamento, estamos comprometidos con esta causa y trabajaremos con asociados estatales, locales y tribales para asegurarnos de que todas las comunidades \u2013 en particular las que han sido descuidadas de manera cr\u00f3nica \u2013 reciban los recursos y el apoyo que necesitan. Compartimos la visi\u00f3n de ustedes en la que las personas con discapacidades y las personas sordas puedan vivir en un mundo sin temor a la violencia dom\u00e9stica o sexual.</p>\n\n<p>Y ahora, doy la bienvenida al podio al Director Carbn de la OVW.</p>\n</div>\n</root>",
